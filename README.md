Android SwingLead Sample
===================================

Introduction
------------

At the moment, this 99% auto-generated template. My only original src is the thread + forloop in MainActivity.java.

This sample shows the use of the [android.widget.TextSwitcher][1] View with animations. A
TextSwitcher is a special type of [android.widget.ViewSwitcher][2] that animates
the current text out and new text in when
[android.widget.TextSwitcher#setText(CharSequence)][3] is called.

Click the "Next" button to set new text in the TextSwitcher and observe the
in and out fade animations.
